v0.2.0 - 2025-03-04 </br>
Added </br>
- Created "Books" and "Comment" Classes for Parse modules
- Added routing between pages. These pages include the home page, list of books page, and the favorites page.
- Also added the ability for users to comment on the books listed on the page by entering their name and ssubmitting a text submission to show up on the book card.
- Additionaly, created a pointer between the "Comment" class and "Books" class to follow the "Rule of 10" and reveal a many-to-one relationship between the two classes. This allows for many comments to be associated with a single book. </br> </br>
Changed </br>
- Changed the backend to be a back4app database rather than a JSON file.
- Switched the main focus of the project from an interactive Notre Dame football website to a popular book-sharing website. The new app resembles a social platform for avid book readers. 
- Began using Webpack and react-vite rather than codesandbox for more robust design. Additionally, used Github rather than codesandbox for version control.
- Changed CSS styling to better suite an earth-toned aesthetic rather than a Notre Dame theme. </br> </br>
Fixed </br>
- Parse modules issues and incosistent updates between the backend and the frontend.
